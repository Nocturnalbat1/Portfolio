            <h3>AITHREATDETECT – Edge AI Threat Detection</h3>
            <p class="project-tagline">
              Onboard threat detection for spacecraft-style bus traffic on Snapdragon RB5.
            </p>
            <p>
              Built a prototype architecture to ingest telemetry/command traffic, analyze it
              with an AI model running on the RB5, and output JSON-based threat reports. Focused
              on constraints like limited compute, near real-time monitoring, and simple CLI workflows.

            <h3>Xworm Malware Dynamic Analysis</h3>
            <p class="project-tagline">
              Sandboxed execution, IOCs, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.
            </p>
            <p>
              Used environments like ANY.Run and Cuckoo Sandbox to monitor Xworm’s behavior, including
              process creation, persistence mechanisms, registry changes, and network C2 traffic.
              Documented IOCs and mapped them to ATT&CK techniques, then proposed blue-team responses.

            <h3>Python: Rock Paper Scissors</h3>
            <p class="project-tagline">
              Building a small Rock Paper Scissors game for users.
            </p>
            <p>
              Built the game loop, handled user input, and implemented conditional 
              decision-making to determine win/loss outcomes. This project helped me 
              strengthen my fundamentals in control flow, input validation, and basic 
              game logic solidifying my foundation before moving into 
              more complex automation and security-focused scripts.
